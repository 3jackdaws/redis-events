Description: # Redis Events
        Event based distributed computing using Redis and asyncio
        
        
        # Usage
        Create a worker that will respond to events:
        
        ```py
        # worker.py
        
        from redis_events import Client, Event
        
        # Point client at Redis server
        client = Client(
            host="mywebsite.com",
            port=6379,
            password="PASSWORD123"
        )
        
        
        @client.event("echo")  # name the event whatever you want
        async def echo_example(event: Event):
            reply_event = Event(
                "echo", # this doesn't actually matter because it is a reply
                event.data  # echo the data that was in the first event
            )
        
            await client.send_reply(event, reply_event)
        
        client.run()
        
        ```
        
        
        Create a script that will push events
        
        ```py
        # send_events.py
        
        from redis_events import Client
        import asyncio
        
        # obviously, must point to the same Redis server as the worker
        client = Client(
            host="mywebsite.com",
            port=6379,
            password="PASSWORD123"
        )
        
        # Everything is async
        async def send_events():
            my_event = Event(
                "echo",
                {"test": 1234}
            )
        
            await client.send(my_event)
        
            reply = await client.wait_for_reply(to=my_event, timeout=60)  # wait for a reply for up to 1 minute
        
            print("GOT REPLY")
        
        
        asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(send_events())
        
        ```
        
        # Installation
        
        `pip install redis-events`
